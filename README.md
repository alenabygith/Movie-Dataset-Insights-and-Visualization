# Movie-Dataset-Insights-and-Visualization
This project analyzes a large movie dataset from Kaggle to explore trends in the film industry. It highlights audience preferences, popular genres, successful directors, and how these factors have evolved over time. Movies play a vital role in shaping global culture.
Data Collection and Cleaning:
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and imported into a jupyter notebook for
analysis. The dataset was really huge contained lots of rows and columns. The entries of
each columns were of different datatypes.
The first step involved removing unnecessary columns that were not relevant for the
current visualization process. Next, duplicated rows were eliminated, data types were
ascertained, and any missing values were corrected. All these steps were performed using
pandas library of python in jupyter notebook.
Data Exploration and Visualization:
This step involved evaluating the data&#39;s accuracy and detecting possible problems.
We visualized some of the columns using simple line and bar charts,
demonstrating the basics of data visualization using Python libraries such as
Matplotlib and Seaborn. A correlation heatmap was created to show the
relationships between different numerical variables, providing information that
would be helpful in subsequent visualization stage.
